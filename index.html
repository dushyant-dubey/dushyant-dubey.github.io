    <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a PhD Research Scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, working in the interdisciplinary domain of Additive Manufacturing and Fiber-reinforced Composites. I have been studying at IIT Delhi since August 2021. I have expertise in X-ray micro computed tomography (microCT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and mechanical characterization.<br><br>
    I am also learning to work with machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models for estimating the mechanical properties of printed composites. Unlike traditional approaches, I aim to implement advanced deep learning techniques (such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent architectures) that can process image-based data from microCT or SEM to directly predict material performance. This addresses the research gap of correlating internal microstructural features with composite properties using spatially-aware learning methods, which is currently underexplored in 3D printed fiber-reinforced composites.
